# Predicting-Road-Accident-Risk
Welcome to the 2025 Kaggle Playground Series! We plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, providing interesting and approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month.

Your Goal: Predict the likelihood of accidents on different types of roads.

For this Playground Series challenge, we have teamed up with Stack Overflow to give you a two-part challenge. The Stack Overflow Challenge is the second part and builds upon this one by having participants develop a web application. We encourage you to check out the Stack Overflow Challenge!

If you complete both challenges, we’ll recognize your breadth of skills with a special “Code Scientist” badge which will appear on both Kaggle and Stack Overflow.
Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error between the predicted and the observed target.

Submission File
For each id in the test set, you must predict a accident_risk of between 0 and 1. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

id,accident_risk
517754,0.352
517755,0.992
517756,0.021
etc.
Timeline
Start Date - October 1, 2025
Entry Deadline - Same as the Final Submission Deadline
Team Merger Deadline - Same as the Final Submission Deadline
Final Submission Deadline - October 31, 2025
All deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary.
